O my Luve is like a red, red rose 
   That’s newly sprung in June; 
O my Luve is like the melody 
   That’s sweetly played in tune. 
So fair art thou, my bonnie lass,
   So deep in luve I am;
And I will luve thee still, my dear, 
   Till a’ the seas gang dry. 
   
the next line is weird
get it up ye ya baw bag
te amo mi amor
never add whatever unless i say so
